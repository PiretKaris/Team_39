**1st teamwork task!**
Discuss meaning of push, pull, commit and add code in GitHub.


Add: The git add command adds changes in the working directory to the staging area. This prepares the changes to be committed. It does not actually save the changes to the repository but stages them for the next commit.

Commit: The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Commits are the core building blocks of a Git project history; they record the changes and allow you to revert to previous states.

Push: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing sends the changes made on your local repository to the remote repository, making them available to others.

Pull: The git pull command fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to your local repository. It combines the actions of git fetch (which downloads the changes) and git merge (which applies the changes).
