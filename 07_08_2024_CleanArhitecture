Testability
A well-structured architecture makes the system easier to test. By decoupling components and enforcing boundaries, 
it becomes simpler to write unit tests for individual parts of the system without needing to rely on external dependencies. 
This isolation allows for more thorough and reliable testing.

Flexibility and Maintainability
A clear structure helps in adapting to changes. When the architecture is well-defined, it's easier to locate and modify 
the parts of the system that need to change. This is crucial in a constantly evolving software environment where requirements and 
technologies change frequently.

Reusability
Structured architecture promotes the reuse of components. By designing components to be independent and loosely coupled, 
they can be reused in different parts of the system or even in different projects. This reduces redundancy and accelerates development.

Scalability
As a system grows, a solid architecture allows it to scale more easily. With a clear structure, adding new features or handling 
increased loads can be done more efficiently without causing a ripple effect of issues throughout the system.

Communication and Understanding
A well-defined architecture acts as a common language among team members, making it easier for them to understand the system's design 
and purpose. It helps new developers get up to speed quickly and ensures that everyone is on the same page regarding the system's 
structure and how different components interact.


‚ú® Layered (N-tier) Architecture ‚ú®

‚ö° Pros
+ Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, which makes the system easier to manage and understand.
+ Ease of Development and Maintenance: Layers can be developed and updated independently.

üñåÔ∏è Cons
- Performance: Multiple layers can introduce latency and reduce performance.
- Rigidity: Changes in one layer might require changes in other layers, making the system less flexible.

‚ú® Microservices Architecture ‚ú®

‚ö° Pros
+ Scalability: Services can be scaled independently.
+ Flexibility in Technology: Each service can use different technology stacks.
+ Fault Isolation: Failures in one service do not affect others.

üñåÔ∏è Cons
- Complexity: Managing multiple services can be complex.
- Deployment Challenges: Requires sophisticated deployment and monitoring mechanisms.
- Data Management: Handling distributed data and maintaining consistency can be challenging.

‚ú® Event-Driven Architecture ‚ú®

‚ö° Pros
+ Asynchronous Communication: Decouples producers and consumers, improving scalability and flexibility.
+ Real-time Processing: Ideal for real-time analytics and monitoring.

üñåÔ∏è Cons
- Complexity: Designing and managing event-driven systems can be complex.
- Debugging: Tracing events across the system can be difficult.

‚ú® Serverless Architecture ‚ú®

‚ö° Pros
+ Cost-Efficiency: Pay only for the actual compute time used.
+ Scalability: Automatically scales with the load.
+ Reduced Maintenance: No server management required.

üñåÔ∏è Cons
- Cold Start Latency: Initial requests can have higher latency.
- Limited Execution Time: Functions have execution time limits, which might not be suitable for long-running tasks.
- Vendor Lock-In: Tightly coupled with cloud provider's services.

‚ú® Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) ‚ú®

‚ö° Pros
+ Decoupling: Encourages separation between the core logic and external systems.
+ Flexibility: Adapters can be easily swapped without affecting the core logic.

üñåÔ∏è Cons
- Complexity: Can introduce complexity due to the need for multiple adapters.
- Learning Curve: Might be harder to understand and implement for those unfamiliar with the concept.

‚ú®  CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) ‚ú®

‚ö° Pros
+ Performance: Optimizes read and write operations separately.
+ Scalability: Read and write workloads can be scaled independently.

üñåÔ∏è Cons
- Complexity: Adds complexity to the system design.
- Consistency: Ensuring data consistency between the command and query models can be challenging.
