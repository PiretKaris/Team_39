1. Calculate total Sales by City

```sql
SELECT Owners.City, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales 
JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode 
JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
JOIN Pets ON Pets.PetID = Sales.PetID
GROUP BY Owners.City
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

2. Calculate total Sales by Pet Kind

```sql
SELECT Pets.Kind, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales 
JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode 
JOIN Pets ON Pets.PetID = Sales.PetID
GROUP BY Pets.Kind
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

3. Calculate total Sales by City and Pet Kind

```sql
SELECT 
    Owners.City, 
    Sales.Country,
    Sales.PetID, 
    SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM 
    Sales
JOIN 
    Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode 
JOIN 
    Pets ON Pets.PetID = Sales.PetID
JOIN
    Owners ON Owners.OwnerID = Pets.OwnerID  -- Assuming Pets table has OwnerID
GROUP BY 
    Owners.City, 
    Sales.Country,
    Sales.PetID;
```

4. Calculate Average sales by City

```sql
SELECT 
    Owners.City, 
    AVG(Procedures.Price) AS AverageSales
FROM 
    Sales 
LEFT JOIN 
    Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN 
    Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN 
    Owners ON Owners.OwnerID = Pets.OwnerID
GROUP BY 
    Owners.City
ORDER BY 
    AverageSales DESC;
```

5. If you have additional time, explore relationships with SQLight

In SQLite, relationships between tables are managed via foreign keys, and we can explore these relationships through various queries. 
This allows to perform powerful analysis, such as aggregating data by different dimensions, finding trends, and identifying key insights from a dataset.

A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables. 
It refers to the primary key in another table, which is called the referenced table or parent table.

A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. 
No two rows can have the same primary key value, and a primary key cannot contain NULL values.
