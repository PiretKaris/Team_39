HIBERNATE / ORM

Hibernate ORM enables developers to more easily write applications 
whose data outlives the application process

Hibernate is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Java
that simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with 
Java objects, rather than manually writing SQL queries. 
It abstracts the complexity of handling relational data in databases and 
maps it to Java objects through annotations or XML configuration. 

Here's an overview:

Key Concepts in Hibernate:
1. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):
    Hibernate maps Java classes (objects) to database tables.
    Each entity class corresponds to a table, and its fields map to columns.
2.Entity:
    A Java class that represents a table in a database.
    It's annotated with @Entity, and its fields represent the columns of the table.
