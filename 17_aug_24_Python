❓1. What is an error rate?


❓2.Where you could use other machine-learning models?


❓3.What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised training?


❓4.How to import different models from the scikit-learn package?


❓5. How can you evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in scikit-learn?

❓6.What metrics are commonly used for evaluation?


❓7.What is model overfitting, and how can it be prevented?
Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data. It can be prevented by using techniques like cross-validation, regularization, or reducing model complexity.
